# GitHub Actions Docker Deployment Report 
 
## Activity Overview 
This report documents the process of setting up GitHub Actions to automatically build and push Docker images to Docker Hub. 
 
## Steps Completed 
 
### 1. Repository Setup 
- [x] Cloned original repository 
- [x] Pushed to personal GitHub account 
- [x] Repository: [Your GitHub Link] 
 
### 2. Docker Hub Configuration 
- [x] Created Docker Hub account 
- [x] Set up repository: [Your Docker Hub Link] 
- [x] Configured GitHub Secrets for authentication 
 
### 3. GitHub Actions Workflow 
- [x] Created `.github/workflows/docker-publish.yml` 
- [x] Configured to trigger on push to main branch 
- [x] Set up Docker Buildx for builds 
- [x] Added Docker Hub login step 
- [x] Configured build and push for React app image 
- [x] Created production docker-compose file 
 
### 4. Testing 
- [x] Made test commit to trigger workflow 
- [x] Verified successful run in GitHub Actions 
- [x] Confirmed image pushed to Docker Hub 
 
## Screenshots Included: 
1. Terminal showing successful git operations 
2. GitHub repository page 
3. Docker Hub repository creation 
4. GitHub Secrets configuration 
5. GitHub Actions workflow running 
6. Successful workflow completion 
7. Docker Hub with pushed image 
 
- **Challenge**: Repository structure was different than expected 
- **Solution**: Modified workflow to build only the React app from root directory 
- **Challenge**: Windows command prompt limitations 
- **Solution**: Used Windows-specific echo commands to create YAML file 
 
## Conclusion 
Successfully implemented CI/CD pipeline using GitHub Actions to automate Docker image build and deployment to Docker Hub. The workflow builds the React application and creates a production-ready docker-compose file.
